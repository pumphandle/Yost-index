# Yost-index

The Yost index is used in public health surveillance to classify small geographic areas into percentiles based on socioeconomic status. It makes use of seven inputs: median income, median home value, median rent, poverty rate, mean educational attainment, unemployment rate, and percent with blue-collar jobs. Each of these inputs is available directly from the American Community Survey of the U.S. Census or can be derived from there.

Since calculating the index is a somewhat laborious process, this repository serves as a place for researchers to access it directly and/or to facilitate further development of the index.
